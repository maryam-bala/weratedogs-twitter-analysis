    "1. Data Gathering \n",
    "  - The WeRateDogs Twitter archive\n",
    "  - The tweet image predictions\n",

    "- The tweet image predictions is hosted on Udacity's servers and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library \n",

    "- Removed +0000 from the timestamp and changed it to datetime format \n",
